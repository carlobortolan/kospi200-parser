Parses and prints quote messages from a market data feed. When invoked with an `-r` flag, the program re-orders the messages according to the quote accept time at the exchange.

It is designed to consume data either directly from UDP broadcast streams on ports 15515/15516 or by replaying an existing pcap file. Quote packets begin with the ASCII bytes `B6034`, and contain the five current best bids and ask liquidity on the market.

This parser is optimized for low-latency environments. It currently uses zero-copy memory mapping (`memmap2`), pushing 8-byte slice pointers to the sliding-window Min-Heap and then formatting outbound strings dynamically via `itoa` without utilizing the `format!` macro or UTF-8 safety checks.

## Performance

**Benchmark (11 GB PCAP file | 42.5M Packets | 32M Quotes)**

- User time (seconds): **22.24 seconds**
- System time (seconds): **1.15 seconds**
- Elapsed (wall clock) time: **23.61 seconds**
- Throughput: **~465 MB/s** (Single-threaded)
- Max application heap: ~4M packets, **~20-30 MB application heap** (bounded dynanically by 3-second reorder window to remain stable at $O(K)$ complexity regardless of total file size).

_Measured on a selfhosted VM with 32 GB RAM, AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U @ 2.70GHz, and Manjaro Linux x86_64_

## Output format:

Prints the packet and quote accept times, the issue code, followed by the bids from 5th to 1st, then the asks from 1st to 5th; e.g.:

```xml
<pkt-time> <accept-time> <issue-code> <bqty5>@<bprice5> ... <bqty1>@<bprice1> <aqty1>@<aprice1> ... <aqty5>@<aprice5>
```

## Example usage:

```sh
# 1. Compile the program:
$ cargo build --release

# 2. Run tests:
$ cargo test

# 3. Parse a pcap file:
$ target/release/parse-quote -r data/mdf-kospi200.20110216-0.pcap
...
1297814429.998584 09002997 KR4301F32505 0000134@00092 0000199@00093 0000231@00094 0000094@00095 0000308@00096 0000234@00097 0000130@00098 0000282@00099 0000415@00100 0000052@00101
...
```

The handler assumes that the difference between the quote accept time and the pcap packet time is never more than 3 seconds.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

This crate requires a Rust version of 1.85.0 or higher. Increases in MSRV will be considered a semver non-breaking API change and require a version increase (PATCH until 1.0.0, MINOR after 1.0.0).
