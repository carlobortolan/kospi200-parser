Parses and prints quote messages from a market data feed. When invoked with an `-r` flag, the program re-orders the messages according to the quote accept time at the exchange.

It is designed to consume data either directly from UDP broadcast streams on ports 15515/15516 or by replaying an existing pcap file. Quote packets begin with the ASCII bytes `B6034`, and contain the five current best bids and ask liquidity on the market.

The parser currently uses zero-copy memory mapping (`memmap2`) to read network traffic. Incoming data is stored in a pre-allocated chunk of memory (arena) that sorts out-of-sequence packets by using a 3-second Min-Heap containing the indeces of the arena and their packet times.

## Performance

**Benchmark (11 GB PCAP file | 42.5M Packets | 32M Quotes)**

- User time (seconds): **20.54 seconds**
- System time (seconds): **0.82 seconds**
- Elapsed (wall clock) time: **21.54 seconds**
- Throughput: **~510 MB/s** , **1.97M PPS**(Single-threaded)
- Max application heap: **<150 KB** (for historical data) **to ~20 MB** (for 5.5M+ packet stress-test bursts); Heap size is bounded dynanically by 3-second reorder window to remain stable at O(K) regardless of total file/input size.

_Measured on a selfhosted VM with 32 GB RAM, AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U @ 2.70GHz, and Manjaro Linux x86_64_

## Output format:

Prints the packet and quote accept times, the issue code, followed by the bids from 5th to 1st, then the asks from 1st to 5th; e.g.:

```xml
<pkt-time> <accept-time> <issue-code> <bqty5>@<bprice5> ... <bqty1>@<bprice1> <aqty1>@<aprice1> ... <aqty5>@<aprice5>
```

## Example usage:

```sh
# Compile for maximum performance
cargo build --release

# Parse a PCAP file with reordering
target/release/parse-quote -r --pcap data/mdf-kospi200.20110216-0.pcap
...
1297814429.998584 09002997 KR4301F32505 0000134@00092 0000199@00093 0000231@00094 0000094@00095 0000308@00096 0000234@00097 0000130@00098 0000282@00099 0000415@00100 0000052@00101
...

# Alternatively, listen to live UDP market data feed
target/release/parse-quote -r --udp 239.0.0.1:15515

```


The handler assumes that the difference between the quote accept time and the pcap packet time is never more than 3 seconds.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

This crate requires a Rust version of 1.85.0 or higher. Increases in MSRV will be considered a semver non-breaking API change and require a version increase (PATCH until 1.0.0, MINOR after 1.0.0).
